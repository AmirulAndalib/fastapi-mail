## Using Jinja2 HTML Templates

In order to use Jinja template langauge, your must specify email folder within your applications working directory.

In sending HTML emails, the CSS expected by mail servers -outlook, google, etc- must be inline CSS. Fastapi mail passes _"body"_ to the rendered template. In creating the template for emails the dynamic objects should be used with the assumption that the variable is named "_body_" and that it is a python dict.

##  Guide for Email Utils

You can connect Redis to save and check email addresses. If you do not provide a Redis configuration, 
then the utility will save it in the list or set by default.



## Writing unittests using Fastapi-Mail
Fastapi mails allows you to write unittest for your application without sending emails to
non existent email address by mocking the email to be sent. To mock sending out mails, set
the suppress configuraton to true. Suppress send defaults to False to prevent mocking within applications.
